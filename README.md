# k8see (Kubernetes Events Exporter)

Kubernetes Events Exporter is a suit of three tools to export kubernertes events in an external database. The goal is to get events in an SQL DB to be able to analyze what happened.

The 3 tools are :

* [k8see-exporter](https://github.com/sgaunet/k8see-exporter) : Deployment inside the kubernetes cluster to export events in a redis stream
* [k8see-importer](https://github.com/sgaunet/k8see-importer) : Tool that read the redis stream to import events in a database (PostGreSQL)
* [k8see-webui](https://github.com/sgaunet/k8see-webui) : Web interface to query the database
* [k8see-deploy](https://github.com/sgaunet/k8see-deploy) : kubernetes manifests to deploy k8see-exporter and also the whole procedure to deploy a full test environment in a k8s cluster (with kind).
